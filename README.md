### File Structure

Something looks like:

├ book.json
├ README.md
├ SUMMARY.md
├ year1/
|   ├ README.md
|   └ courseID+author.md
└ year2/
    ├ README.md
    └ courseID+author.md
```

`courseID + authorName` + suffix, default prefix for `courseID` is `CSE`

eg. `207-dexhunter.md` is a review material for CSE207 written by DexHunter

### The reason for this repo

* Multi-choice questions of exam are not listed at the past year paper database
* Reduce the cost of finding answers from books
* save students' time (so we can do something more meaningful)
* A lot of teachers just gave the questions without answers or points without giving explanation (which are annoying).
