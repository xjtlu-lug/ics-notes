### Notion of an agent

* Def1: An *agent* is a computer system that is capable of **independent** action on behalf of its user or owner.
* Def2: An *agent* is a **computer system** capable of **autonomous action** in some **environment**, in order to achieve its **delegated goals**.

### Notion of multi-agent systems

* A *multi-agent system* is one that consists of a number of agents, which **interact** with one-another.
* In most general cases, agents will be acting on behalf of users with different goals and motivations.
* To unsuccessfully interact, they will require the ability to **cooperate**, **coordinate**, and **negotiate** with each other, much as people do.

### Properties of Environments

* Accessible vs. inaccessible
* Deterministic vs. non-deterministic
* Static vs. dynamic
* Discrete vs. continuous
 
### Decisions and Actions

* The key problem for an agent is to decide which of its action to perform in order to best satisfy its(design) objectives.

### Intelligent Agents

* Reactivity: perceive environment, response quickly to changes 
* Pro-activeness: take goal-directed behavior 
* Social ability: interact with other agents
    * cooperation
    * coordination
    * negotiation


### Difference between objects and agents

* Objects encapsulate some states
* Objects communicate via message passing
* Objects have methods corresponding to operations that may be performed on this state
* 
* Agents embody a stronger notion of autonomy than objects - in particular they decide whether or not to perform an action on request from another agent
* Agents are capable of flexible behavior
