## Software Engineering Introduction

* What is software engineering?
* What are the two fundamental types of software products?
    * answer: generic products and customized product 
* What is a SW process? In general, what are the four SW process activities?
    * sw specification, sw development, sw validation, sw evolution  
* What are the attributes of good software?
    * Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and
    * should be maintainable, dependable and usable
    * maintaiability, dependability and security, efficiency, accptability
* General issues that affect most software 
    * heterogeneity, business and social change, security and trust 
* Application Types
    * batch processing systems, entertainment systems, systems for modeling and simulation, data collection system, systems of systems 


## Process model
* The waterfall model
    * plan-driven model. Separate and distinct phases of specification and development. 
* Incremental development
    * Specification, development and validation are interleaved. Maybe plan-driven or agile. 
* Four stages of Reuse-based Development
    * 1. component analysis 2. requirements modification 3. system design with reuse 4. development and integration 
* How to reduce the costs of rework?
    * change avoidance, where the software process includes activities that can anticipate possible changes before significant rework is required
    * change tolerance, where the process is designed so that changes can be accommodated at relatively low cost
* Prototype
    * A prototype is an initial version of a system used to demonstrate concepts and try out design options 
* Benefits of prototyping
    * improved system usability 
    * a closer match to users' real needs
    * improved design quality
    * improved maintainability
    * reduced development effect
* Incremental delivery advantages and problems
#### Advantages
    * customer value can be delivered with each increment so system functionality is available eariler, 
    * early increments act as a prototype to help elicit requirements for later increments, 
    * lower risk of overall project failure, 
    * the highest priority system services tend to receive the most testing 
#### Problems
    * Most systems require a set of basic facilities that are used by different parts of the system
    * The essence of iterative processes is that the specification is developed conjunction within the software

## Process model

* Boehmâ€™s spiral model
* 
* The Rational Unified Process
    * a modern generic processes derived from the work on the UML and associated processes 
* RUP good practice
    * develop software iteratively
    * manage requirements
    * use component-based architectures
    * visually model software 
    * verify software quality
    * control changes to software
